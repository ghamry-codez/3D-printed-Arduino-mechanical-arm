# 3D-printed-Arduino-mechanical-arm
This is a project for a mechanical arm made using Arduino components and 3D prints.


This arm relies on 4 axis of motion and took me months to develop. This project is still very emperimental and has some bugs that must be solved. If any problems arise for you, dont hesitate to contact me.
